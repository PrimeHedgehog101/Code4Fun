\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{i)}
Find the equilibrium points $x^*$ of the following dynamical system:
$$\dot{x} = 4x - x^3$$
Use linear stability analysis or graphical analysis to classify the stability of the equilibrium points $x^*$.
Sketch the graph of $x(t)$ versus $t$ for each of the following initial conditions: $x(0) = \frac{1}{2}$, $x(0) = -3$.
\subsection*{ii)}
For the dynamical system
$$\dot{x} = rx - \cosh x +1$$
find the value (or values) of $r$ at which a bifurcation occurs and classify
the type of bifurcation as saddle-node, transcritical, subcritical pitch-fork or supercritical pitchfork. Then sketch the bifurcation diagram of
equilibrium points $x^*$ versus $r$.
\subsection*{iii)}
Consider the system in polar coordinates:
\[
\dot{r} = r(r - 2)(r - 3), \quad \dot{\theta} = -2.
\]

(a) Identify the limit cycles and determine their stability. Sketch the phase portrait of the system in the plane $(x, y)$, where $x = r \cos \theta$ and $y = r \sin \theta$. 
\\
(b) Show that the system
\[
\dot{r} = r - 10r^2 + 2r^3 + \sin (2\theta) + 1, \quad \dot{\theta} = -2.
\]
has a closed orbit in the region between $r = 0$ and $r = 1$.
\\
(c) Show that the system \begin{align*}
\dot{x}&=-2x+4y
\\ \dot{y}&=-2x-2y^3
\end{align*}
has no closed orbits, by considering the Liapunov function $V(x,y)=x^2+ay^2$ for some value $a$.
